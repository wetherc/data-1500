# Common Table Expressions

A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a way to create temporary result sets within a query. That is, it's a way to create short-lived intermediate tables that you can query with SQL just as though they were regular database tables.

The syntax for a CTE looks like

```sql
WITH cteName AS (
  SELECT <columns>
  FROM <table>
)

SELECT *
FROM cteName;
```

As a simple example, we can create a CTE that's just a temporary result set of only action films:

```sql
WITH action_films AS (
  SELECT
    f.title,
    f.length
  FROM film f
  JOIN film_category fc
    ON fc.film_id = f.film_id
  JOIN category c
    ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
  WHERE c.name = 'Action'
)

SELECT
  title,
  length
FROM action_films;
```

We aren't limited to just a single CTE within a query; you can use multiple in a row as well! We just comma separate each new CTE in the query:

```sql
WITH film_stats AS (
  SELECT
    AVG(rental_rate) AS avg_rental_rate,
    MAX(length) AS max_length,
    MIN(length) AS min_length
  FROM film
),
customer_stats AS (
  SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers,
    SUM(amount) AS total_payments
  FROM payment
)

SELECT
  ROUND((SELECT avg_rental_rate FROM film_stats), 2) AS avg_film_rental_rate,
  (SELECT max_length FROM film_stats) AS max_film_length,
  (SELECT min_length FROM film_stats) AS min_film_length,
  (SELECT total_customers FROM customer_stats) AS total_customers,
  (SELECT total_payments FROM customer_stats) AS total_payments;
```

## Exercise 01: Simple CTE

Write a query that

  - Creates a CTE called `staff_addresses` that includes:
    - address id
    - street address
    - city
    - country

Use this CTE to write a query that selects:

  - all staff addresses;
  - the store each staff member works at; and
  - the staff member's store manager


## Exercise 02: Multiple CTEs

Write a query that:

  - Creates a CTE called `weekly_rentals` which selects:
    - The `COUNT()` of movies rented each week;
    - The `COUNT()` of movies returned each week;
    - The store id that the movie was rented from;
    - The calendar week (HINT: you can use `DATE_PART('week', rental_date) AS rental_week`)
  - Creates a CTE called `weekly_revenues` which selects:
    - The `SUM()` of rental amounts each week;
    - The store id that the rentals were made from;
    - The calendar week
   
Using these two CTEs, write a query that selects:
  - The total number of movies rented each week per store;
  - The total number of movies returned each week per store;
  - The average price per movie rented each week per store;
  - The store id;
  - The calendar week

HINT: you can `JOIN` on the calendar week column that you created in both CTEs just like any other normal column! To `JOIN` on multiple criteria,

```sql
SELECT <columns>
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2
  ON t1.first_col = t2.first_col
 AND t1.second_col = t2.second_col
```


## Exercise 03: Still more CTEs!

Write a query that:

  - Creates a CTE called `actor_movies` that selects:
    - Actor first name and last name;
    - The number of movies that they have starred in;
    - The film category name;
    - The film release year;
    - Grouped by actor name, film genre, and film release year
  - Creates a CTE called `yearly_movies` that selects:
    - The actor name;
    - The number of movies that they have starred in;
    - The year
    - NOTE: select this information from the `actor_movies` CTE that you just created!

Using this CTE, write a query that selects:
  - Each actor's first and last name;
  - The year in which they starred in the most movies;
  - The number of movies they starred in from that year;
  - The genre of movie that they starred in most that year;
  - The number of movies in that genre they starred in from that year
